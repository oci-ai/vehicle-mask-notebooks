$ pip3 install --upgrade pip
```

Then install the Jupyter Notebook using:

```
$ pip3 install jupyter
```

```
$ git clone https://github.com/oci-ai/vehicle-mask-notebooks.git
```

## Install other environmental variables.
```
pip3 install cv2
pip3 install imageio
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install tensorflow
pip3 install matplotlib
pip3 install scipy
```
