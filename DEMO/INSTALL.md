## Install Jupyter Notebook

https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

As an existing Python user, you may wish to install Jupyter using Pythonâ€™s package manager, pip, instead of Anaconda.

First, ensure that you have the latest pip; older versions may have trouble with some dependencies:

```
$ pip3 install --upgrade pip
```

Then install the Jupyter Notebook using:

```
$ pip3 install jupyter
```

```
$ git clone https://github.com/oci-ai/vehicle-mask-notebooks.git
```

```
$ cd DEMO

$ jupyter notebooks
```
